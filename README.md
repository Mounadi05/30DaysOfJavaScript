# LeetCode 30DaysOfJavascript Challenge
# Challenge Overview
Welcome to the LeetCode 30DaysOfJavascript Challenge! 

### Challenge Description

The LeetCode 30DaysOfJavascript Challenge is a curated set of coding problems that cover various aspects of JavaScript programming. The challenge is structured to provide you with a comprehensive learning experience, helping you strengthen your JavaScript knowledge and problem-solving skills.

The challenge consists of 32 problems, each focusing on different JavaScript concepts and techniques. The problems are divided into three categories: closures, basic array transformations, promises and time, JSON, and classes.

The basic array transformations category will guide you through applying transformations to arrays, including filtering elements, reducing arrays, and working with function compositions.

The promises and time category introduces you to working with JavaScript promises and handling asynchronous operations. solve problems related to adding promises, implementing sleep functionality, and executing cancellable functions with delays.

The JSON category focuses on working with JavaScript objects and JSON data. solve problems such as checking if an object is empty, chunking arrays, and sorting objects.

Lastly, the classes category will cover topics related to object-oriented programming in JavaScript. solve problems like implementing an event emitter, working with array wrappers, and creating a calculator with method chaining.
